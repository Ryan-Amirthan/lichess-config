## Introduction

Welcome to the reference for the Lichess API! Lichess is free/libre, open-source chess server powered by volunteers and donations.

## Endpoint

All requests go to `https://lichess.org` (unless otherwise specified).

## Clients

- [Python general API](https://github.com/lichess-org/berserk)
- [MicroPython general API](https://github.com/mkomon/uberserk)
- [Python general API - async](https://pypi.org/project/async-lichess-sdk)
- [Python Lichess Bot](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot)
- [Python Board API for Certabo](https://github.com/haklein/certabo-lichess)
- [Java general API](https://github.com/tors42/chariot)
- [JavaScript & TypeScript general API](https://github.com/devjiwonchoi/equine)
- [LichessNET - C# API Wrapper](https://github.com/Rabergsel/LichessNET)

## Rate limiting

All requests are rate limited using various strategies, to ensure the API remains responsive for everyone. Only make one request at a time. If you receive an HTTP response with a [429 status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#429), please wait a full minute before resuming API usage.

## Streaming with ND-JSON

Some API endpoints stream their responses as [Newline Delimited JSON a.k.a. **nd-json**](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec), with one JSON object per line.

Here's a [JavaScript utility function](https://gist.github.com/ornicar/a097406810939cf7be1df8ea30e94f3e) to help reading NDJSON streamed responses.

## Authentication

### Which authentication method is right for me?

[Read about the Lichess API authentication methods and code examples](https://github.com/lichess-org/api/blob/master/example/README.md)

### Personal Access Token

Personal API access tokens allow you to quickly interact with Lichess API without going through an OAuth flow.

- [Generate a personal access token](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token)
- `curl https://lichess.org/api/account -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"`
- [NodeJS example](https://github.com/lichess-org/api/tree/master/example/oauth-personal-token)

### Token Security

- Keep your tokens secret. Do not share them in public repositories or public forums.
- Your tokens can be used to make your account perform arbitrary actions (within the limits of the tokens' scope). You remain responsible for all activities on your account.
- Do not hardcode tokens in your application's code. Use environment variables or a secure storage and ensure they are not shipped/exposed to users. Be especially careful that they are not included in frontend bundles or apps that are shipped to users.
- If you suspect a token has been compromised, revoke it immediately.

To see your active tokens or revoke them, see [your Personal API access tokens](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token).

### Authorization Code Flow with PKCE

The authorization code flow with PKCE allows your users to **login with Lichess**. Lichess supports unregistered and public clients (no client authentication, choose any unique client id). The only accepted code challenge method is `S256`. Access tokens are long-lived (expect one year), unless they are revoked. Refresh tokens are not supported.

See the [documentation for the OAuth endpoints](#tag/OAuth) or the [PKCE RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4) for a precise protocol description.

- [Flask/Python example](https://github.com/lakinwecker/lichess-oauth-flask)

- [English Chess Federation](https://ecf.octoknight.com/)
- [Rotherham Online Chess](https://rotherhamonlinechess.azurewebsites.net/tournaments)

### Token format

Access tokens and authorization codes match `^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$`. The length of tokens can be increased without notice. Make sure your application can handle at least 512 characters. By convention tokens have a recognizable prefix, but do not rely on this.
